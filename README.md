# TASK8
Working with VPNs



This repository contains my work for **Task 8: Working with VPNs** as part of my internship.

---

##  Task Overview
- Install and configure a free VPN client.  
- Connect to a VPN server using WireGuard (UDP).  
- Verify the VPN connection by comparing IP addresses before and after connection.  
- Take screenshots and document the steps.  
- Research VPN features (protocols, encryption, policies, limitations).

##  How to Reproduce
1. Sign up for a free VPN (ProtonVPN or Windscribe).  
2. Install the VPN client on your system.  
3. Check your IP before connection at [whatismyipaddress.com].  
4. Connect to a server using **WireGuard (UDP)** protocol.  
5. Check your IP again and confirm it has changed.  
6. Save screenshots of before/after IPs and VPN client.

##  Key Learnings
- VPN changes your public IP and encrypts your traffic.  
- WireGuard protocol provides fast and secure tunneling.  
- Free VPN tiers have limitations (bandwidth, servers, speed).  
- VPNs improve privacy but do not guarantee complete anonymity.

##  Submission
The completed report and screenshots are submitted here for Task 8.
